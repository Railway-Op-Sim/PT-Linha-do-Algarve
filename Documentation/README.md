# Linha do Algarve

This simulation covers the Algarve Line between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo Antonio along the south Portuguese coast in the Algarve region a popular holiday destination for tourists. The line was constructed in multiple stages between 1889 and the 1940s.

The map includes all the stations along the line along with a few sidings, with timetabled services for the local Regionais Comboios trains, intercity services and express trains to Faro from Lisbon:

- Regional: Lagos - Faro
- Regional: Faro - Vila Real de Santo Antonio
- Intercity: Lisbon - Faro
- Alfa Pendular: Lisbon - Faro

## Simulation

The timetable is based on timetables provided by the national operator Comboios de Portugal. Although level crossings are present on the line, these have been excluded due to Railway Operation Simulator penalising users for keeping level crossings open for too long, and there being no intermediate signals on the signal track regions.

### Tips

* There is a very low frequency of services on the line meaning the simulation can even be run at 16x speed if preferred.

* Services towards Lisbon spawn on the second platform from the top at Faro (track IDs 81-27 and 82-27) it is therefore recommended that you avoid terminating services in this platform in case of collisions.

* Service 5801 terminates at Portimao before returning to Lagos, make sure to route it into the platform with the reverse shunt signal. This applies in general, make sure there is a starter signal for return trips.
